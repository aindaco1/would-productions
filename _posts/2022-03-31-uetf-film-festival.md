We are excited to announce that our proposed bilingual film festival, _Sin Fronteras_, was selected for funding by the Urban Enhancement Trust Fund's Resiliency Residency Program! Our festival will take place in 2023 (dates to be finalized) and our focus is to highlight the stories of immigrants on both sides of the southern border.

We plan on making _Sin Fronteras_ a recurring festival.

## Highlights

* Fully bilingual
* Inclusive of different genres (not just arthouse movies)
* Connect our local community to non-Hollywood films telling our stories
* Help filmmakers create industry connections (Netflix, NM Film Office)
* Panels to help new filmmakers improve productions, raise money
* Prizes for winning filmmakers
* Reception for screening filmmakers
* Awards ceremony (COVID-permitting)
* 300 attendees at the festival, to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico
* 300 attendees to the virtual festival
* Screen 15 feature films, 50 short films

More info to come soon -- we are grateful to have the UETF's support!
