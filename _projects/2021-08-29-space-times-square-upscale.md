## Background

Drawing from Sartre, McLuhan, and Baudrillard, _Space Times Square_ decodes Times Square as a microcosm of the electronic big bang â€” an expanding electronic cosmos of voids and nothingnesses, image and information, enlightenment and ignorance, entertainment and inquisition, iPod people and hive-minds, flash mobs and flat-screens, black holes and vanishing points, war and bankruptcy, cyberspace and outer space, existentialism and nihilism.

We used AI software to upscale the original standard definition film to 1080p.

Equipment used:

* AviSynth+
* AviSynth Shader
* AviSynth AIUpscale
