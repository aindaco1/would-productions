## Background

_Your Mission_ is our music review podcast which we stream live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/yourmissionpod). For each episode, childhood friends Jenny, Ryan and Alonso go on a musical mission -- they take music of all genres and dive deep, break it apart, cut it down to size, share emotional baggage, and rate it. Each episode is recorded remotely and edited at the Would Productions studio in Corrales, New Mexico.
