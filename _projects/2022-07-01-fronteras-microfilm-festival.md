## Background

_Fronteras Microfilm Festival and Exhibit_ is envisioned as a bilingual microfilm festival and exhibition, provoking dialogue around national borders. We are actively looking for funding and sponsorships to kick off the inaugural festival in 2023.

## Concept

We are soliciting short films, from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, each with a “border” theme, to exhibit in a unique series of installations. Films will be in both Spanish and English and be subtitled. Each installation will use directional speakers to prevent cacophony.

The installations include:

- Vertical slat border wall
- Border patrol checkpoint
- Semi-truck trailer
- Surveillance station
- Detention center
- Deportation bus

The freedom of movement between installations is determined by “visa” status — at the opening of the installation, visas are assigned randomly, with a “donation” ensuring choice of status.

Each visa status will represent a different track — those without a visa have a circumscribed route through very specific, guarded views of the installations, while those with a visa will have complete freedom of movement between installations with a different, more open view of each. The undocumented track can double back to the beginning through a special deportation bus installation. There will be opportunities for folks in the undocumented track to cross over to the visa track, with guards periodically checking for documentation.

Both tracks will end in a common, open mingling area outdoors. This area will be decorated as desert at night, with a projection of a starry sky and the ridge of the Milky Way above, and a small, otherworldly-lit “river” dividing the area in half — directly inspired by the International Dark Sky Reserve at Big Bend National Park on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The exhibition will include several actors as border guards and checkpoint personnel.

## Inspirations

Primarily, this exhibition is inspired by two cultural objects: Marcel Duchamp’s _Étant donnés_, an assemblage permanently installed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art since 1969, and Alfonso Cuaron’s 2006 film _Children of Men_.

As _Étant donnés_ encourages active engagement by forcing the normally passive gallery visitor to look through a peephole, our installation engages the visitor through roleplay, choice, and constrained viewing. And just as _Children of Men_ posits a world in the midst of a global catastrophe, with a reactionary, nationalist solution in place and a refugee as the source of humanity’s last hope, our installation seeks to provoke conversation about the impermanence of borders in the face of the natural world and the accident of geography in birth.
